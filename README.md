SEng422 Summer 2014 Repository
========
This is the repository for Software Engineering 422: Software Architecture course at UVic over Summer 2014.

This is our code, enjoy!

Despite the code you get in this repo, Software architecture is still quite difficult and will definitely take some time to wrap your head around. Start your assignment early. Good luck.
